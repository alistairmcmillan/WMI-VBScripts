WMI-VBScripts
=============

A few VB scripts that I've thrown together to help diagnose Windows PC faults.

PC Health Check
---------------

Gives you basic stats about RAM, Virtual Memory, Hard Drive space, etc.

Remote Process Dump
-------------------

Gives you a list of all the running processes on a remote machine including how much RAM and VM used per process.

Check Size of Queries Folder
----------------------------

Identifies which user profiles have Microsoft Queries folders and what size they are. This is to deal with a [specific Excel bug](http://alistairmcmillan.tumblr.com/post/7627301133/favourite-microsoft-bug-of-2009) we encountered.
